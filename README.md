# Retinanet
RetinaNet has been formed by making two improvements over existing single stage object detection models (like YOLO and SSD): Feature Pyramid Networks for Object Detection, Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection.
<br /> 
<br /> 
Feature Pyramid Networks for Object Detection:
<br /> 
Pyramid networks have been used conventionally to identify objects at different scales. A Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) makes use of the inherent multi-scale pyramidal hierarchy of deep CNNs to create feature pyramids.

<br /> 
<br /> 
Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection:
<br /> 
Focal Loss is an improvement on cross-entropy loss that helps to reduce the relative loss for well-classified examples and putting more focus on hard, misclassified examples.
