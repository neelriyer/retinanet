# Retinanet
RetinaNet has been formed by making two improvements over existing single stage object detection models (like YOLO and SSD):

Feature Pyramid Networks for Object Detection:
Pyramid networks have been used conventionally to identify objects at different scales. A Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) makes use of the inherent multi-scale pyramidal hierarchy of deep CNNs to create feature pyramids.

Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection:
Focal Loss is an improvement on cross-entropy loss that helps to reduce the relative loss for well-classified examples and putting more focus on hard, misclassified examples.
